# Adding Cultural Lessons Manually

To manually add cultural lessons to the Eshu platform, you can use the Supabase SQL Editor or connect directly to your database.

## Database Table: `cultural_lessons`

The lessons are stored in the `cultural_lessons` table with the following structure:

- `id`: Auto-generated unique identifier
- `title`: The lesson title (text)
- `description`: Brief description of the lesson (text)
- `duration`: Estimated time to complete (e.g., "15 minutes")
- `difficulty`: Difficulty level ("Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced")
- `icon`: Icon name from Lucide React (e.g., "Users", "MapPin", "Heart")
- `content`: JSON array containing the lesson content sections
- `created_at`: Auto-generated timestamp

## Adding a New Lesson

### Option 1: Using Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Use this template to insert a new lesson:

```sql
INSERT INTO cultural_lessons (title, description, duration, difficulty, icon, content)
VALUES (
  'Your Lesson Title',
  'Brief description of what this lesson covers',
  '20 minutes',
  'Beginner',
  'Users',
  '[
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "Introduction paragraph explaining the topic..."
    },
    {
      "type": "heading",
      "content": "Section Title"
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "More detailed explanation with examples..."
    },
    {
      "type": "list",
      "content": [
        "First important point",
        "Second important point",
        "Third important point"
      ]
    }
  ]'::jsonb
);
```

### Option 2: Using a Database Client

Connect to your PostgreSQL database and insert records directly.

## Content Structure

The `content` field is a JSON array that supports different content types:

### Text Content
```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "content": "Your paragraph text here..."
}
```

### Headings
```json
{
  "type": "heading",
  "content": "Section Title"
}
```

### Lists
```json
{
  "type": "list",
  "content": [
    "First item",
    "Second item",
    "Third item"
  ]
}
```
